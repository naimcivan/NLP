I am going to work on the following topics:

1) Retrieving information
Information retrieval: return documents in response to a user query (Internet Search is a special case)
Information extraction: discover specific information from a set of documents (e.g. companies and their founders)
Question answering: answer a specific user question by returning a section of a document.


2) Opinion mining and sentiment analysis
Finding out what people think about politicians, products, companies etc.
Typically done on web documents and social media


3) Automated fact checking
Classify statements and news articles as factual or not
In an effort to combat misinformation


4) Abusive language detection
Automated detection and moderation of online abuse
Hate speech, racism, sexism, personal attacks, cyberbullying etc
